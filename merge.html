    <span class="main">
        The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this
        algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.
    </span>

    <p class="sub_head"> How does Merge Sort Work?</p>

    <p>lets consider an array arr[] = {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10}

        At first, check if the left index of array is less than the right index, if yes then calculate its mid point</p>

    <p>Now, as we already know that merge sort first divides the whole array iteratively into equal halves, unless the
        atomic values are achieved.
        Here, we see that an array of 7 items is divided into two arrays of size 4 and 3 respectively.</p>

    <p>Now, again find that is left index is less than the right index for both arrays, if found yes, then again
        calculate mid points for both the arrays.</p>

    <p>Now, further divide these two arrays into further halves, until the atomic units of the array is reached and
        further division is not possible.</p>

    <p>
        After dividing the array into smallest units, start merging the elements again based on comparison of size of
        elements
        Firstly, compare the element for each list and then combine them into another list in a sorted manner.</p>

    <p>After the final merging, the list looks like this:</p>
