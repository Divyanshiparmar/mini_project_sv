    <h1 class="head">QUICK SORT</h1>

    <span class="main">QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the
        given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different
        ways.

        Always pick the first element as a pivot.
        Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
        Pick a random element as a pivot. <br>
        Pick median as the pivot. <br>
        The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of
        an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller
        than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear
        time.</span>

    <p class="sub_head">Illustration of partition() : </p>
    <p>Consider: arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70}

        Indexes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
        low = 0, high = 6, pivot = arr[h] = 70
        Initialize index of smaller element, i = -1
    </p>

    <img src="quick1.jpg" alt="">
    <p> Traverse elements from j = low to high-1
        j = 0: Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j]) i=0 arr[]={10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70} // No
            change as i and j are same j=1: Since arr[j]> pivot, do nothing
    </p>

    <img src="quick2.jpg" alt="">

    <p>
        j = 2 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j]) i=1 arr[]={10, 30, 80, 90, 40, 50, 70} // We swap
            80 and 30 </p>


            <img src="quick3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>j = 3 : Since arr[j] > pivot, do nothing // No change in i and arr[]
                j = 4 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap(arr[i], arr[j]) i=2 arr[]={10, 30, 40, 90, 80, 50, 70} //
                    80 and 40 Swapped</p>


                    <img src="quick4.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>j = 5 : Since arr[j] <= pivot, do i++ and swap arr[i] with arr[j] i=3 arr[]={10, 30, 40, 50, 80,
                            90, 70} // 90 and 50 Swapped </p>

                            <img src="quick5.jpg" alt="">

                            <p>
                                We come out of loop because j is now equal to high-1.
                                Finally we place pivot at correct position by swapping arr[i+1] and arr[high] (or pivot)
                                arr[] = {10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, 80} // 80 and 70 Swapped </p>


                            <img src="quick6.jpg" alt="">

                            <p>
                                Now 70 is at its correct place. All elements smaller than 70 are before it and all
                                elements greater than 70 are after it.
                                Since quick sort is a recursive function, we call the partition function again at left
                                and right partitions,</p>

                            <p>Again call function at right part and swap 80 and 90</p>
